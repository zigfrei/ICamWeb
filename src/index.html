                        Delay is defined as an extra time spent by drivers
                        against their expectation. Delay can have many forms
                        depending on different locations. Accurate estimation of
                        delays has many implications in traffic engineering
                        studies. Transportation planners will use delay to
                        evaluate economic loses, whereas traffic engineers will
                        use delays to determine level of service at signalized
                        intersections. There are several methods of conducting
                        intersection delays: Licence-plate method,
                        sample-counting or cycle-based method.

                        There are many reasons for pedestrian counts. Counts are
                        often required in the street design process as inputs to
                        transport models, for capacity assessments, to measure
                        the attractiveness of different spaces, to estimate
                        route choices or for the appraisal of different design
                        options.

                        Pedestrians are more difficult to count than motor
                        vehicles or bicycles because their paths are much less
                        constrained. Pedestrians can stand, pace back and forth,
                        use a wheelchair, or walk by in groups with no light
                        gaps in-between them to be detected by a counter.

                        While automated counting technology for motor vehicles
                        has been in use for many years, automated pedestrian
                        counting technology is less developed. Most pedestrian
                        counts are done manually (see photo), but this method
                        suffers from variations in quality depending on the
                        reliability of the person counting. Automated counting
                        would be preferred if a reliable technology, or group of
                        technologies can be deployed.
